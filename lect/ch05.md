## DEVICE CONTROLLERS
-  I/O devices have components
    - Mechanical component
    - Electronic component
- Electronic component controls the device
    - May be able to handle multiple devices
    - May be more than one controller per mechanical component (example: hard drive)
- Controller's tasks
    - Convert serial bit stream to block of bytes • Perform error correction as necessary
    - Make available to main memory


## MEMORY-MAPPED I/O
![fig01](ch05/ch05-fig01.png)￼

## HOW IS MEMORY-MAPPED I/O DONE?
![fig02](ch05/ch05-fig02.png)￼
- Single-bus
    - All memory accesses go over a shared bus
    - I/O and RAM accesses compete for bandwidth
- Dual-bus
    - RAM access over high-speed bus
    - I/O access over lower-speed bus
    - Less competition
    - More hardware (more expensive...)


## DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DMA)
![fig03](ch05/ch05-fig03.png)￼


## HARDWARE’S VIEW OF INTERRUPTS
![fig04](ch05/ch05-fig04.png)￼


## I/O SOFTWARE: GOALS
- Device independence
    - Programs can access any I/O device
    - No need to specify device in advance
- Uniform naming
    - Name of a file or device is a string or an integer
    - Doesn’t depend on the machine (underlying hardware)
- Error handling
    - Done as close to the hardware as possible
    - Isolate higher-level software
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous transfers
    - Blocked transfers vs. interrupt-driven
- Buffering
    - Data coming off a device cannot be stored in final destination
- Sharable vs. dedicated devices


## PROGRAMMED I/O:  PRINTING A PAGE
![fig05](ch05/ch05-fig05.png)￼


## CODE FOR PROGRAMMED I/O
```c
copy_from_user(buffer, p, count); 	// copy into kernel pffer
for (j=0; j<count; j++) {			// loop for each char
		while(*printer_status_reg != READY)
			;
		*printer_data_reg = p[j];
}
return_to_user();
```

## INTERRUPT-DRIVEN I/O
- CODE RUN BY SYSTEM CALL￼
```c
copy_from_user(buffer, p, count);
j = 0;
enable_interrupts();
while(*printer_status_reg != READY)
	;
*printer_data_reg = p[0];
scheduler();	// and block user
```
- CODE RUN AT INTTERUPT TIME
```c
if (count == 0) {
	unblock_user();
} else {
	*printer_data_reg = p[j];
	count--;
	j++;
}
acknowledge_interrupt();
```


## I/O USING DMA
- CODE RUN BY SYSTEM CALL￼
```c
copy_from_user(buffer, p, count);
set_up_DMA_controller();
scheduler();	// and block user
```
- CODE RUN AT INTTERUPT TIME
```c
acknowledge_interrupt();
unblock_user();
return_from_interrupt();
```


## LAYERS OF I/O SOFTWARE
![fig06](ch05/ch05-fig06.png)￼


## INTERRUPT HANDLERS
- Interrupt handlers are best hidden
    - Driver starts an I/O operation and blocks
    - Interrupt notifies of completion
- Interrupt procedure does its task
    - Then unblocks driver that started it
    - Perform minimal actions at interrupt time
        - Some of the functionality can be done by the driver after it is unblocked
- Interrupt handler must
    - Save registers not already saved by interrupt hardware
    - Set up context for interrupt service procedure

## WHAT HAPPENS ON AN INTERRUPT
- Set up stack for interrupt service procedure
- Ack interrupt controller, reenable interrupts
- Copy registers from where saved
- Run service procedure
- (optional) Pick a new process to run next
- Set up MMU context for process to run next
- Load new process' registers
- Start running the new process

## DEVICE DRIVERS
![fig07](ch05/ch05-fig07.png)
- Device drivers go between device controllers and rest of OS
    - Drivers standardize interface to widely varied devices
- Device drivers communicate with controllers over bus
    - Controllers communicate with devices themselves

## DEVICE-INDEPENDENT I/O SOFTWARE
- Device-independent I/O software provides common “library” routines for I/O software
- Helps drivers maintain a standard appearance to the rest of the OS
- Uniform interface for many device drivers for • Buffering
    - Error reporting
    - Allocating and releasing dedicated devices
    - Suspending and resuming processes
- Common resource pool
    - Device-independent block size (keep track of blocks) - Other device driver resources

## WHY A STANDARD DRIVER INTERFACE?
![fig08](ch05/ch05-fig08.png)
- Non-standard device driver interface
    - Different interface for each driver
    - High operating system complexity
    - Less code reuse
- Standard device driver interface
    - Less OS/driver interface code
    - Lower OS complexity
    - Easy to add new

## BUFFERING DEVICE INPUT
![fig09](ch05/ch05-fig09.png)￼￼

## WHAT HAPPENS WHERE ON AN I/O REQUEST?
![fig10](ch05/ch05-fig10.png)￼￼

## DISK DRIVE STRUCTURE
![fig11](ch05/ch05-fig11.png)
- Data stored on surfaces
    - Up to two surfaces per platter
    - One or more platters per disk
- Data in concentric tracks
    - Tracks broken into sectors
        - 256B-1KB per sector
    - Cylinder: corresponding tracks on all surfaces
- Data read and written by heads
    - Actuator moves heads
    - Heads move in unison

## DISK DRIVE SPECIFICS
|     | IBM 360KB floppy | Hitachi 500GB HD |
| :-: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
| cylinders | 40 | 132,000 (estimate) |
| tracks per cylinder | 2 | 10 |
| sectors per track | 9 | 750 (average) |
| bytes per sector | 512 | 512 |
| capacity | 360KB | 500GB |
| seek time (minimum) | 6 ms | 2 ms |
| seek time (average) | 77 ms | 8.5 ms |
| rotation time | 200 ms | 8.33 ms |
| spinup time | 250 ms | -5 sec |
| sector transfer time | 22 ms | 11 μsec |
 ￼

## DISK “ZONES”
![fig12](ch05/ch05-fig12.png)
- Outside tracks are longer than inside tracks
- Two options for longer tracks
    - Bits are “bigger”
    - More bits (transfer faster)
- Modern hard drives use second option
    - More data on outer tracks
- Disk divided into “zones”
    - Constant sectors per track in each zone
    - 8–30 (or more) zones on a disk

DISK “ADDRESSING”
- Millions of sectors on the disk must be labeled
- Two possibilities
    - Cylinder/track/sector
    - Sequential numbering
- Modern drives use sequential numbers
    - Disks map sequential numbers into specific location
    - Mapping may be modified by the disk
        - Remap bad sectors
        - Optimize performance
    - Hide the exact geometry, making life simpler for the OS

## BUILDING A BETTER “DISK”
- Problem: CPU performance has been increasing exponentially, but disk performance hasn’t
    - Disks are limited by mechanics
- Problem: disks aren’t all that reliable
- Solution: distribute data across disks, and use some of the space to improve reliability
    - Data transferred in parallel
    - Data stored across drives (striping)
    - Parity on an “extra” drive for reliability

## RAIDs, RAIDs, AND MORE RAIDs
![fig13](ch05/ch05-fig13.png)
- CD-ROM has data in a spiral
    - Hard drives have concentric circles of data
- One continuous track: just like vinyl records!
- Pits & lands “simulated” with heat-sensitive material on CD-Rs and CD-RWs


## CD-ROM recording
![fig14](ch05/ch05-fig14.png)￼
- CD-ROM has data in a spiral
    - Hard drives have concentric circles of data
- One continuous track: just like vinyl records!
- Pits & lands “simulated” with heat-sensitive material on CD-Rs and CD-RWs


## STRUCTURE OF A DISK SECTOR
![fig15](ch05/ch05-fig15.png)￼￼￼￼
- Preamble contains information about the sector
    - Sector number & location information
- Data is usually 256, 512, or 1024 bytes
- ECC (Error Correcting Code) is used to detect & correct minor errors in the data


## SECTOR LAYOUT ON DISK
![fig16](ch05/ch05-fig16.png)￼￼￼￼
- Sectors numbered sequentially on each track
- Numbering starts in different place on each track: sector skew
    - Allows time for switching head from track to track
- All done to minimize delay in sequential transfers
- In modern drives, this is only approximate!


## SECTOR INTERLEAVING
![fig17](ch05/ch05-fig17.png)￼￼￼￼
- On older systems, the CPU was slow => time elapsed between reading consecutive sectors
- Solution: leave space between consecutively numbered sectors
- This isn’t done much these days...


## WHAT’S IN A DISK REQUEST?
- Time required to read or write a disk block determined by 3 factors
    - Seek time
    - Rotational delay
        - Average delay = 1/2 rotation time
        - Example: rotate in 10 ms, average rotation delay = 5 ms
    - Actual transfer time
        - Transfer time = time to rotate over sector
        - Example: rotate in 10 ms, 200 sectors/track ⇒ 10/200 ms = 0.05 ms transfer time per sector
- Seek time dominates, with rotation time close
- Error checking is done by controllers


## DISK REQUEST SCHEDULING
- Goal: use disk hardware efficiently
    - Bandwidth as high as possible
    - Disk transferring as often as possible (and not seeking)
- We want to
    - Minimize disk seek time (moving from track to track)
    - Minimize rotational latency (waiting for disk to rotate the desired sector under the read/write head)
- Calculate disk bandwidth by
    - Total bytes transferred / time to service request
    - Seek time & rotational latency are overhead (no data is transferred), and reduce disk bandwidth
- Minimize seek time & rotational latency by
    - Using algorithms to find a good sequence for servicing requests
    - Placing blocks of a given file “near” each other


## DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
![fig18](ch05/ch05-fig18.png)￼￼￼￼
- Schedule disk requests to minimize disk seek time
    - Seek time increases as distance increases (though not linearly)
    - Minimize seek distance -> minimize seek time
- Disk seek algorithm examples assume a request queue & head position (disk has 200 cylinders)
    - Queue = 100, 175, 51, 133, 8, 140, 73, 77
    - Head position = 63


## FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVED {FCFS}
![fig19](ch05/ch05-fig19.png)￼￼￼￼
- Requests serviced in the order in which they arrived
    - Easy to implement!
    - May involve lots of unnecessary seek distance
- Seek order = 100, 175, 51, 133, 8, 140, 73, 77
- Seek distance = (100-63) + (175-100) + (175-51) + (133-51) + (133-8) + (140-8) + (140-73) + (77-73) = 646 cylinders


## SHORTEST SEEK TIME FIRST {SSTF}
![fig20](ch05/ch05-fig20.png)￼￼￼￼
- Service the request with the shortest seek time from the current head position
    - Form of SJF scheduling
    - May starve some requests
- Seek order = 73, 77, 51, 8, 100, 133, 140, 175
- Seek distance = 10 + 4 + 26 + 43 + 92 + 33 + 7 + 35 = 250 cylinders


## SCAN (ELEVATOR ALGORITHM)
![fig21](ch05/ch05-fig21.png)￼￼￼￼
- Disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests as it goes
    - Reverses direction when it gets to end of the disk
    - Also known as elevator algorithm
- Seek order = 51, 8, 0 , 73, 77, 100, 133, 140, 175
- Seek distance = 12 + 43 + 8 + 73 + 4 + 23 + 33 + 7 + 35 = 238 cyles.


## C-SCAN
![fig22](ch05/ch05-fig22.png)￼￼￼￼
- Identical to SCAN, except head returns to cylinder 0 when it reaches the end of the disk
    - Treats cylinder list as a circular list that wraps around the disk
    - Waiting time is more uniform for cylinders near the edge of the disk
- Seek order = 73, 77, 100, 133, 140, 175, 199, 0, 8, 51
- Distance = 10 + 4 + 23 + 33 + 7 + 35 + 24 + 199 + 8 + 43


## C-LOOK
![fig23](ch05/ch05-fig23.png)￼
- Identical to C-SCAN, except head only travels as far as the last request in each direction
    - Saves seek time from last sector to end of disk
- Seek order = 73, 77, 100, 133, 140, 175, 8, 51
- Distance = 10 + 4 + 23 + 33 + 7 + 35 + 167 + 43 = 322 cylinders


## PICKING A DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
- SSTF is easy to implement and works OK if there aren’t too many disk requests in the queue
- SCAN-type algorithms perform better for systems under heavy load
    - More fair than SSTF
    - Use LOOK rather than SCAN algorithms to save time
- Long seeks aren’t too expensive, so choose C-LOOK over LOOK to make response time more even
- Disk request scheduling interacts with algorithms for allocating blocks to files
    - Make scheduling algorithm modular: allow it to be changed without changing the file system
- Use SSTF for lightly loaded systems
- Use C-LOOK for heavily loaded systems


## WHEN GOOD DISKS GO BAD…
![fig24](ch05/ch05-fig24.png)￼
- Disks have defects
    - In nearly a billion sectors, this isn’t surprising!
- ECC helps with errors, but sometimes this isn’t enough
- Disks keep spare sectors (normally unused) and remap bad sectors into these spares
    - If there’s time, the whole track could be reordered...


## FLASH MEMORY
- Compared to disk, flash is
    - Faster (shorter access time, but lower bandwidth) • More expensive
- Compared to DRAM, flash is
    - Cheaper (a bit)
    - Non-volatile (data survives power loss)
    - Slower
- Use flash as a level between disk and memory?
- Problems
    - Flash wears out: can only write 10,000–100,000 times per memory cell
    - Flash isn’t too reliable: lots of bit errors


## HANDLING FLASH IN THE OS
- Treat it like a disk?
    - Flash is written in blocks, just like a disk
        - Blocks have to be erased first: somewhat slow
    - Flash is random access, just like a disk
    - This approach is often used!
- Need to be careful about wearing out flash
    - Most flash devices do “wear leveling”: remap blocks internally when they’re erased
    - File systems for flash should take wear into account
        - Many don’t, including the standard VFAT file system


## CLOCK HARDWARE
- Crystal oscillator with fixed frequency (only when computer is on)
    - Typically used to time short intervals (~ 1 second)
    - May be used to correct time-of-day clock
- Time-of-day clock (runs when system is off) • Keeps minutes, hours, days
    - May not be too accurate...
    - Used to load system clock at startup
- Time kept in seconds and ticks (often 100–1000 per second)
    - Number of seconds since a particular time
        - For many versions of Unix, tick 0 was on January 1, 1970
    - Number of ticks this second
    - Advance ticks once per clock interrupt
    - Advance seconds when ticks “overflow”


## KEEPING TIME
- Check time via the Web
    - Protocol to get time from accurate time servers
- What happens when system clock is slow?
    - Advance clock to the correct current time
    - May be done all at once or over a minute or two
- What happens when clock is fast?
    - Can’t have time run backwards!
    - Instead, advance time more slowly than normal until the clock is correct
- Track clock drift, do periodic updates to keep clock accurate


## USNIG TIMERS IN SOFTWARE
![fig25](ch05/ch05-fig25.png)￼
- Use short interval clock for timer interrupts
    - Specified by applications
    - No problems if interrupt frequency is low
- May have multiple timers using a single clock chip
- Use soft timers to avoid interrupts
    - Kernel checks for soft timer expiration before it exits to user mode
    - Less accurate than using a hardware timer
    - How well this works depends on rate of kernel entries


## WHERE DOES THE POWER GO?
![fig26](ch05/ch05-fig26.png)￼￼
- How much power does each part of a laptop computer use?
    - Two studies: 1994 & 1998
    - Most power to the display!
- Save power by
    - Reducing display power
    - Slowing down CPU
    - Cutting power used by disk


## REDUCING CPU POWER USAGE
![fig27](ch05/ch05-fig27.png)
-  Running at full clock speed
    - Jobs finish quickly
    - High energy consumption: proportional to shaded area
    - Intel processors may use 50–75 watts!
- Cutting voltage by two
    - Cuts clock speed by two: processes take longer
    - Cuts power by four
    - Cuts energy consumption (= power - time) in half


## HOW CAN WE REDUCE POWER USAGE?
- Telling the programs to use less energy
    - May mean poorer user experience
    - Makes batteries last longer!
- Examples
    - Change from color output to black and white • Speech recognition reduces vocabulary
    - Less resolution or detail in an image
    - Fewer image updates per second
