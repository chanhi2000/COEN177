    - Avoiding deadlock
    - Preventing deadlock


## RESOURCES
- Resource: something a process uses
    - Usually limited (at least somewhat)
- Examples of computer resources
    - Printers
    - Semaphores / locks
    - Tables (in a database)
- Processes need access to resources in reasonable order
- Two types of resources:
    - Preemptable resources: can be taken away from a process with no ill effects
    - Non-preemptable resources: will cause the process to fail if taken away


## WHEN DO DEADLOCKS HAPPEN?
![fig01](ch03/ch03-fig01.png)￼
- Suppose
    - Process 1 holds resource A and requests resource B
    - Process 2 holds B and requests A
    - Both can be blocked, with neither able to proceed
- Deadlocks occur when ...
    - Processes are granted exclusive access to devices or software constructs (resources)
    - Each deadlocked process needs a resource held by another deadlocked process (CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY)


## USING RESOURCES
- Sequence of events required to use a resource
    - Request the resource
    - Use the resource
    - Release the resource
- Can’t use the resource if request is denied
    - Requesting process has options
        - Block and wait for resource
        - Continue (if possible) without it: may be able to use an alternate resource
        - Process fails with error code
    - Some of these may be able to prevent deadlock...


## WHAT IS A DEADLOCK?
- Formal definition: “A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.”
- Usually, the event is release of a currently held resource
- In deadlock, none of the processes can
    - Run
    - Release resources
    - Be awakened


## 4 CONDITIONS FOR DEADLOCK
- Mutual exclusion
    - Each resource is assigned to at most one process
- Hold and wait
    - A process holding resources can request more resources
- No preemption
    - Previously granted resources cannot be forcibly taken away
- Circular wait
    - There must be a circular chain of 2 or more processes where each is waiting for a resource held by the next member of the chain


## RESOURCE ALLOCATION GRAPHS
![fig02](ch03/ch03-fig02.png)￼
- Resource allocation modeled by directed graphs
- Example 1:
    - Resource R assigned to process A
- Example 2:
    - Process B is requesting / waiting for resource S
- Example 3:
    - Process C holds T, waiting for
    - Process D holds U, waiting for
    - C and D are in deadlock!


## DEALING WITH DEADLOCK
- How can the OS deal with deadlock?
    - Ignore the problem altogether!
        - Hopefully, it’ll never happen...
    - Detect deadlock & recover from it
    - Dynamically avoid deadlock
        - Careful resource allocation
    - Prevent deadlock
        - Remove at least one of the four necessary conditions
- We’ll explore these tradeoffs


## GETTING INTO DEADLOCK
![fig03](ch03/ch03-fig03.png)￼


## NOT GETTING INTO DEADLOCK ...
- Many situations may result in deadlock (but don’t have to)
    - In previous example, A could release R before C requests R, resulting in no deadlock
    - Can we always get out of it this way?
- Find ways to:
    - Detect deadlock and reverse it
    - Stop it from happening in the first place


## THE OSTRICH ALGORITHM
- Pretend there’s no problem
- Reasonable if
    - Deadlocks occur very rarely
    - Cost of prevention is high
- UNIX and Windows take this approach
    - Resources (memory, CPU, disk space) are plentiful
    - Deadlocks over such resources rarely occur
    - Deadlocks typically handled by rebooting
- Trade off between convenience and correctness


## DETECTING DEADLOCKS USING GRAPHS
![fig04](ch03/ch03-fig04.png)￼
- Process holdings and requests in the table and in the graph (they’re equivalent)
- Graph contains a cycle ⇒ deadlock!
    - Easy to pick out by looking at it (in this case)
    - Need to mechanically detect deadlock
- Not all processes are deadlocked (A, C, F not in deadlock)


## DEADLOCK DETECTION ALGORITHM
![fig05](ch03/ch03-fig05.png)￼
- General idea: try to find cycles in the resource allocation graph
- Algorithm: depth-first search at each node
    - Mark arcs as they’re traversed
    - Build list of visited nodes
    - If node to be added is already on the list, a cycle exists!
- Cycle ⇒ deadlock


## RESOURCES WITH MULTIPLE INSTANCES
- Previous algorithm only works if there’s one instance of each resource
- If there are multiple instances of each resource, we need a different method
    - Track current usage and requests for each process
    - To detect deadlock, try to find a scenario where all processes can finish
    - If no such scenario exists, we have deadlock


## DEADLOCK DETECTION ALGORITHM
![fig06](ch03/ch03-fig06.png)


## RECOVERING FROM DEADLOCK
- Recovery through preemption
    - Take a resource from some other process
    - Depends on nature of the resource and the process
- Recovery through rollback
    - Checkpoint a process periodically
    - Use saved state to restart the process if it’s in deadlock
    - May present a problem if the process affects lots of “external” things
- Recovery through killing processes
    - Crudest but simplest way to break a deadlock: kill one of the processes in the deadlock cycle
    - Other processes can get its resources
    - Try to choose a process that can be rerun from the start
        - Pick one that hasn’t run too far already

## BANKER’S ALGORITHM FOR A SINGLE RESOURCE
![fig10](ch03/ch03-fig10.png)￼
- Bankers’ algorithm: before granting a request, ensure that a sequence exists that will allow all processes to complete
    - Use previous methods to find such a sequence
    - If a sequence exists, allow the requests
    - If there’s no such sequence, deny the request
- Can be slow: must be done on each request!


## BANKER’S ALGORITHM FOR MULTIPLE RESOURCES
![fig11](ch03/ch03-fig11.png)￼


## PREVENTING DEADLOCK
- Deadlock can be completely prevented!
- Ensure that at least one of the conditions for deadlock never occurs
    - Mutual exclusion
    - Circular wait
    - Hold & wait
    - No preemption
- Not always possible...


## ELIMINATING MUTUAL EXCLUSION
- Some devices (such as printer) can be spooled
    - Only the printer daemon uses printer resource
    - This eliminates deadlock for printer
- Not all devices can be spooled
- Principle:
    - Avoid assigning resource when not absolutely necessary
    - As few processes as possible actually claim the resource


## ATTACKING ‘HOLD AND WAIT”
- Require processes to request resources before starting
    - A process never has to wait for what it needs
- This can present problems
    - A process may not know required resources at start of run
    - This also ties up resources other processes could be using
        - Processes will tend to be conservative and request resources they might need
- Variation: a process must give up all resources before making a new request
    - Process is then granted all prior resources as well as the new ones
    - Problem: what if someone grabs the resources in the meantime—how can the process save its state?


## ATTACKING “NO PREEMPTION”
![fig12](ch03/ch03-fig12.png)￼￼
- This is not usually a viable option
- Consider a process given the printer
    - Halfway through its job, take away the printer
    - Confusion ensues!
- May work for some resources
    - Forcibly take away memory pages, suspending the process
    - Process may be able to resume with no ill effects


## ATTACKING “CIRCULAR WAIT”
![fig13](ch03/ch03-fig13.png)￼￼
- Assign an order to resources
- Always acquire resources in numerical order
    - Need not acquire them all at once!
- Circular wait is prevented
    - A process holding resource n can’t wait for resource m if m < n
    - No way to complete a cycle
        - Place processes above the highest resource they hold and below any they’re requesting
        - All arrows point up!


## DEADLOCK PREVENTION: SUMMARY
- Mutual exclusion
    - Spool everything
- Hold and wait
    - Request all resources initially
- No preemption
    - Take resources away
- Circular wait
    - Order resources numerically


## EXAMPLE: TWO-PHASE LOCKING
- Phase One
    - Process tries to lock all data it needs, one at a time
    - If needed data found locked, start over
    - (no real work done in phase one)
- PhaseTwo
    - Perform updates
    - Release locks
- Note similarity to requesting all resources at once
- This is often used in databases
- It avoids deadlock by eliminating the “hold-and-wait” deadlock condition


## “NON-RESOURCE” DEADLOCK
- Possible for two processes to deadlock
    - Each is waiting for the other to do some task
- Can happen with semaphores
    - Each process required to do a down() on two semaphores (mutex and another)
    - If done in wrong order, deadlock results
- Semaphores could be thought of as resources...


## STARVATION
- Algorithm to allocate a resource
    - Give the resource to the shortest job first
- Works great for multiple short jobs in a system
- May cause long jobs to be postponed indefinitely
    - Even though not blocked
- Solution
    - First-come, first-serve policy
- Starvation can lead to deadlock
    - Process starved for resources can be holding resources
    - If those resources aren’t used and released in a timely fashion, shortage could lead to deadlock


## LIVELOCK
- Sometimes, processes can still run, but not make progress
- Example: two processes want to use resources A and B
    - P0 getsA,P1 gets B
    - Each realizes that a deadlock will occur if they proceed as planned!
    - P0 drops A, P1 drops B
    - P0 gets B,P1 getsA
    - Same problem as before
    - This can go on for a very long time...
- Real-world example: Ethernet transmission collisions
    - If there’s a “collision” on the wire, wait and try again
    - Multiple processes waited the exact same amount of time...
