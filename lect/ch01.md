# CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW

## WHAT’S OPERATING SYSTEM?
- software + hardware
- interface
- resource manager
- processes
- abstraction / simplification
- user
- communication / data
- tool
- purpose / objective
- useful


## WHAT IS AN OS?
- It’s a program that runs on the “raw” hardware
    - Acts as an intermediary between computer and users
    - Standardizes the interface to the user across different types of hardware: extended machine
        - Hides the messy details which must be performed
        - Presents user with a virtual machine, easier to use
    - It’s a resource manager
        - Each program gets time with the resource
        - Each program gets space on the resource
    - May have potentially conflicting goals:
        - Use hardware efficiently
        - Give maximum performance to each user


## OS TIMELINE
- #### 1st generation: 1945 – 1955
    - Vacuum tubes
    - boards
- #### 2nd generation: 1955 – 1965
    - Transistor
    - Batch systems
- #### 3rd generation: 1965 – 1980
    - Integrated circuits
    - Multiprogramming
- #### 4th generation: 1980 – present
    - Large scale integration
    - Personal computers
- #### 5th generation: ??? (maybe 2001–?)
    - Systems connected by high-speed networks?
    - Wide area resource management?
    - Peer-to-peer systems?


## 1ST GENERATION: DIRECT INPUT
- Run one job at a time
    - Enter it into the computer (might require rewiring!)
    - Run it
    - Record the results
- **Problem**: lots of wasted computer time!
    - Computer was idle during first and last steps
    - Computers were very expensive!
- **Goal**: make better use of an expensive commodity: computer time


## 2ND GENERATION: BATCH SYSTEMS
![fig01](ch01/ch01-fig01.png)

- Bring cards to 1401
- Read cards onto input tape
- Put input tape on 7094
- Perform the computation, writing results to output tape
- Put output tape on 1401, which prints output


## STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL 2ND GEN JOB
￼![fig02](ch01/ch01-fig02.png)


## SPOOLING
- Original batch systems used tape drives
- Later batch systems used disks for buffering
    - Operator read cards onto disk attached to the computer
    - Computer read jobs from disk
    - Computer wrote job results to disk
    - Operator directed that job results be printed from disk
- Disks enabled simultaneous peripheral operation on-line (spooling)
    - Computer overlapped I/O of one job with execution of another
    - Better utilization of the expensive CPU
    - Still only one job active at any given time


## 3RD GENERATION: MULTIPROGRAMMING
![fig03](ch01/ch01-fig03.png)
￼
- Multiple jobs in memory
    - Protected from one another
- Operating system protected from each job as well
- Resources (time, hardware) split between jobs
- Still not interactive
    - User submits job
    - Computer runs it
    - User gets results minutes (hours, days) later


## TIMESHARING
- Multiprogramming allowed several jobs to be active at one time
    - Initially used for batch systems
    - Cheaper hardware terminals ⇒ interactive use
- Computer use got much cheaper and easier
    - No more “priesthood”
    - Quick turnaround meant quick fixes for problems

- Server operating systems: FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux
- Multiprocessor operating systems: Cellular IRIX
- Personal computer operating systems: MacOS X, Windows Vista, Linux
- Real-time operating systems: VxWorks
- Embedded operating systems
- Smart card operating systems
-
> Some operating systems can fit into more than one category


## COMPONENTS OF A SIMPLE PC
![fig04](ch01/ch01-fig04.png)
￼

## STORAGE PYRAMID
![fig05](ch01/ch01-fig05.png)
￼
- **Goal**: really large memory with very low latency
    - Latencies are smaller at the top of the hierarchy
    - Capacities are larger at the bottom of the hierarchy
- **Solution**: move data between levels to create illusion of large memory with low latency

> **LIE**: ONE THINGS AREN’T NECESSARILY VALUABLE THAN OTHER.  TIME vs. PRICE


## DISK DRIVE STRUCTURE
![fig06](ch01/ch01-fig06.png)

- Data stored on surfaces
    - Up to two surfaces per platter
    - One or more platters per disk
- Data in concentric tracks
    - Tracks broken into sectors - 256B–1KB per sector
    - Cylinder: corresponding tracks on all surfaces
- Data read and written by heads
    - Actuator moves heads
    - Heads move in unison



## MEMORY
![fig07](ch01/ch01-fig07.png)
* Single base/limit pair: set for each process
* Two base/limit registers: one for program, one for data


##ANATOMY OF A DEVICE REQUEST
![fig08](ch01/ch01-fig08.png)￼

- Sequence as seen by hardware
    - Request sent to controller, then to disk
    - Disk responds, signals disk controller which tells interrupt controller
    - Interrupt controller notifies CPU
- Interrupt handling (software point of view)


## OS CONCEPTS
- Many of these should be familiar to Unix users…
- **Processes** (and trees of processes)
- **Deadlock**
- File systems & directory trees
- Pipes
- We’ll cover all of these in more depth later on, but it’s useful to have some basic definitions now


##PROCESSES
![fig09](ch01/ch01-fig09.png)￼

- **Process**: program in execution
    - Address space (memory) the program can use
    - State (registers, including program counter & stack pointer)
- OS keeps track of all processes in a process table
- **Processes can create other processes**
    - Process tree tracks these relationship
    - A is the root of the tree
    - A created three child processes: B, C, and D
    - C created two child processes: E and F
    - D created one child process: G
> **Q**: What if the parent process die?
> **A**: do not make a commitment, let other to deal with it (config)


## INSIDE A (UNIX) PROCESS
![fig10](ch01/ch01-fig10.png)￼

- Processes have three segments
    - **Text**: program code (self-modifying code is BAD)
    - **Data**: program data
        - statically declared variables
        - areas allocated by malloc() or new
    - **Stack**:
        - Automatic variables
        - Procedure (function) call information [RECURSIVE]
- Address space growth
    1. **Text**: doesn’t grow
    2. **Data**: grows “up”
    3. **Stack**: grows “down”


## DEADLOCK
![fig11](ch01/ch01-fig11.png)￼

- caused by poor resource management
    - potential deadlock: might / might not
    - *i.e.* pot finder
    - **Undo** or kill one of the “trucks”
    - fragile (must follow 4 conditions)


## HIERARCHICAL FILE SYSTEMS
![fig12](ch01/ch01-fig12.png)￼

- Folders (could be a file or folder)
- 9 Byte IDs (#): good for computer


## INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION
￼
- Processes want to exchange information with each other
- Many ways to do this, including
    - **Network**
    - **Pipe (special file)**: A writes into pipe, and B reads from it


## SYSTEM CALLS
- OS runs in privileged mode
    - Some operations are permitted only in privileged (also called supervisor or system) mode
        - **Example**: access a device like a disk or network card
        - **Example**: change allocation of memory to processes
    - User programs run in user mode and can’t do the operations
- Programs want the OS to perform a service
    - Access a file
    - Create a process
    - Others...
- Accomplished by system call


## HOW SYSTEM CALLS WORK
- User program enters supervisor mode
    - Must enter via well-defined entry point
- Program passes relevant information to OS ! OS performs the service if
    - The OS is able to do so
    - The service is permitted for this program at this time
- OS checks information passed to make sure it’s OK
    - Don’t want programs reading data into other programs’ memory!
- OS needs to be paranoid!
    - Users do the darnedest things....


## MAKING A SYSTEM CALL
![fig13](ch01/ch01-fig13.png)￼￼

- System call: read (fd, buffer, length)
- Program pushed arguments calls library
- Library sets up trap, calls OS
- OS handles system call
- Control returns to library
- Library returns to user program

> * fewer # of system calls
>    * less codes
>    * smaller the OS as a whole
>    * better caching
>    * less complexity
> * more # of system calls
>    * better functionality


## SYSTEM CALLS FOR FILES & DIRECTORIES
![fig14](ch01/ch01-fig14.png)￼￼


## MORE SYSTEM CALLS

## A SIMPLE SHELL
![fig16](ch01/ch01-fig16.png)￼￼


## OS STRUCTURE
- OS is composed of lots of pieces
    - Memory management
    - Process management
    - Device drivers
    - File system
- How do the pieces of the operating system fit together and communicate with each other?
- Different ways to structure an operating system
    - **Monolithic**
        - Modular is similar, but more extensible
    - **Virtual machines**
    - **Microkernel**


## MONOLITHIC OS STRUCTURE
![fig17](ch01/ch01-fig17.png)￼￼

- All of the OS is one big “program”
    - Any piece can access any other piece
- Sometimes modular (as with Linux)
    - Extra pieces can be dynamically added
    - Extra pieces become part of the whole
- Easy to write, but harder to get right…


## VIRTUAL MACHINES
![fig18](ch01/ch01-fig18.png)￼￼

- First widely used in VM/370 with CMS
- Available today in VMware (and Qemu, sort of)
    - Allows users to run any x86-based OS on top of Linux or NT
- “Guest” OS can crash without harming underlying OS
    - Only virtual machine fails—rest of underlying OS is fine
- “Guest” OS can even use raw hardware
    - Virtual machine keeps things separated


## MICROKERNALS (CLIENT-SERVER)
![fig19](ch01/ch01-fig19.png)￼
￼
- **Processes** (clients and OS servers) don’t share memory
    - Communication via message-passing
    - Separation reduces risk of “byzantine” failures
- Examples include
    - Mach (used by MacOS X)
    - Minix
