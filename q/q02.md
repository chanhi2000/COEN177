## 1. 
FIFO scheduling may possibly result in starvation.  ➔ [F] (only when rate of arrival > rate of completion) 


## 2. 
Monolithic operating systems limit the amount of code that runs in supervisor mode to the minimum. ➔ [F] 

## 3.
System calls to the OS have lower overhead (i.e., take less time) than function calls that are made within the same program. ➔ [F] 


## 4. 
The best scheduling algorithm is always the one that maximizes the number of jobs completed per unit time. ➔ [F] 


## 5. 
The operating system that best meets the goals of the operating systems’ programmer is always the best choice for the customer. ➔ [F] 


## 6. 
A monolithic operating system typically supports only a single large process. ➔ [F] 


## 7. 
The desire for good scheduling only applies to processes. ➔ [F] 


## 8. 
Operating systems evolution occurred independently from, and was never influenced by, changes in computer hardware technology. ➔ [F] 


## 9. 
Each process only contains one stack ... and only one stack ... ever. ➔ [F] 


## 10.
The core of the operating system, its kernel, typically runs in a special supervisor mode that is allowed more limited control (i.e., less control) over hardware than typical user processes. ➔ [F]
