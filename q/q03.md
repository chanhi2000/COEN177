## 1.
The best-fit algorithm for memory allocation is always the 
best choice.  ➔ [F] 


## 2.
FIFO scheduling may possibly result in starvation. [T: week6-b]  ➔ [F] 


## 3.
Monolithic operating systems limit the amount of code that runs in supervisor mode to the minimum.  ➔ [F: microkernel] 


## 4.
Page table size is not affected by the address space size (or, the size of an address in bits).  ➔ [F: virtual address space] 


## 5.
A monolithic operating system typically supports only a single process. [T: Monolithic kernel is a single large processes running entirely in a single address space]  ➔ [F] 


## 6.
FIFO page replacement might experience Belady’s anomaly  ➔ [T: see week6-b] 


## 7.
Second chance page replacement is better than FIFO, because it is easier to implement. [T: see week6-b] ➔  [F] 


## 8.
Multiprogramming is beneficial for systems that perform I/O (i.e., allow individual user processes to block waiting for I/O).  ➔ [T: Multiprogramming is the rapid switching of the CPU between multiple processes in memory. It is done only when the currently running process requests I/O, or terminates] 


## 9.
Page replacement algorithms attempt to decide which page to evict from memory when necessary.  ➔ [T: swap out] 


## 10.
Deadlocked processes may continue running if we wait long enough and are very lucky.  ➔ [T: ] [F]
