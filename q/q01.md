## 1. 
Among a typical operating systems’ goals is the abstraction and simplification of underlying hardware for the programmer. ➔ [T] 


## 2.
Monolithic operating systems incur **greater** overhead in handling system calls than Microkernel operation systems.  ➔ [F] 


## 3.
System calls to the OS have much **lower** overhead (i.e., take less time) than function calls. (context switching / ambiguity)  ➔ [X] 

## 4.
Operating systems are concerned with efficiency. And when we we say efficiency we are **always** referring to speed of completing tasks.  ➔ [F] 


## 5. 
An operating system that offers a smaller number of system calls is **definitely worse** than an operating system that offers more system calls.  ➔ [F] (true, sometimes) 


## 6. 
Early computers (1950s and 60s) had processors that used less energy than current processors.  ➔ [F] 


## 7. 
Timesharing was developed because users wanted to run multiple programs simultaneously **to improve CPU utilization**.  ➔ [F] (true, focus on the users themselves) 


## 8. 
Computing hardware evolved, and this affected operating system designs and goals.  ➔ [T] 


## 9. 
It’s a **bad** idea for operating systems to allow user programs to disable interrupts any time they need to do so.  ➔ [T/F] (“any time they need to do so“) 


## 10.
The operating system kernel, running in supervisor mode, must contain every piece of code provided by the OS vendor. ➔ [F]
