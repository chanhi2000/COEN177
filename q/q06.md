## 1.
Programmed I/O requires less involvement from the main CPU than DMA-driven I/O. ➔ [F] 


## 2.
For the same set of track requests, the C-SCAN algorithm is guaranteed to travel a shorter overall physical distance than the SCAN algorithm. ➔ [F] 


## 3.
Bitmaps can be used to track free space in main memory, but not on disk. ➔ [F] 


## 4.
The best disk head scheduling algorithm is clearly C-LOOK. ➔ [F] 


## 5.
LRU is not practical for page replacement in main memory, but is very practical for caching of disk blocks. ➔ [T] 


## 6.
FCFS (i.e., FIFO, or simply treating the requests in the order they are received) for disk head scheduling is typically considered a very good choice. ➔ [F] 


## 7.
Paging (for memory management) means that we no longer need to worry about algorithms like best-fit vs. worst-fit vs. next-fit when selecting a free region of main memory. ➔ [T] 


## 8.
The best disk head scheduling algorithm is always the one that results in the least possible total disk arm movement. ➔ [F] 


## 9.
A bus route that visits stations in a loop, is most similar to which of the following disk head scheduling algorithms:  ➔ [C-SCAN] 


## 10.
A bus route that visits stations in a loop, but which can change its route to skip empty stations, is most similar to which of the following disk head scheduling algorithms:  ➔ [C-LOCK]
