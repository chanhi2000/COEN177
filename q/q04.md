## 1.
Would you be able to tell the difference between second chance page replacement, and clock page replacement, by looking at the sequence of page misses (only the sequences, not the timing)? ➔ [F] 


## 2.
FIFO page replacement might experience Belady's anomaly. ➔ [T] 


## 3.
Multiprogramming is considered by most people to be easy to implement on systems that do not have hardware support for memory limits (e.g., systems lacking features like base and limit registers, or unable to support virtual memory in hardware). ➔ [F] 


## 4.
Two-level page tables allow operating systems software to track virtual memory with data structures that use less memory than would be the case with single-level page tables. ➔ [T] 


## 5.
You must prevent all four conditions of deadlock in order to be sure that a deadlock will not occur ➔ [F] 


## 6.
FIFO/FCFS scheduling will definitely result in starvation. ➔ [F] 


## 7.
Early computers (1950s and 60s) had much slower clock speeds than current processors and therefore definitely used less electricity. ➔ [F] 


## 8.
Inverted page tables require space that is proportional to the size of a process' address space. ➔ [F] 


## 9.
Best-fit selection of free memory regions is clearly the best policy for making efficient use of computer memory. ➔ [F] 


## 10.
Bitmaps are data structures that can be used effectively for keeping track of free space in memory. ➔ [T]
