# lab04

Your goal in this assignment is not to implement any major new code, but to conduct an experiment using the simplest possible code you can develop to read/write a fixed amount of data from/to a file. The deliverable is any code you write, and a report, all of which are intended to answer one question: How fast is I/O when using the filesystem? This question is deliberately vague (the “speed” can vary depending on whether you are reading or writing, on how much data -if any - is being read/written, and how the underlying OS is performing data caching), but your goal is to come up with a result (or set of results) that can answer this question to the best of your ability.
 
You have the freedom to use any programming language you wish, but we will be supporting C in the lab, and you are encouraged to use C (or a similarly lower-level language) to make sure you can explain clearly the operations you are timing. You can time operations within your code, or use command-line tools like “time” to measure the runtime of your test program.
 
You may use any command line tools, scripting languages, or simply C to run your experiments and collect your performance numbers, but for assignment credit you should explain how you decided to conduct your experiment.

Your work will be judged on the quality and precision of your final report describing your experiment.

Good Luck!
