[SCU] Operating System

## COURSE OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this course is to understand and use the basic concepts of operating systems, common to most computer systems, which interfaces the machine with the programmer. In particular, this class is meant to introduce concepts such as the processing unit, process management, synchronization, memory management and I/O management.

The successful student will be able to understand the basic components of a computer operating system, and the interactions among the various components. The course will cover an introduction on the policies for scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, synchronization, and file systems. The students will implement programming problems with C.


## SPECIFIC LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Understand the basic OS functionality: CPU scheduling, process management, main memory management, secondary storage management, I/O devices, file management, security.
2. Apply the concepts in process management, such as allocating resources to processes, handling inter-process communication, multi-threading, deadlock detection and avoidance.
3. Apply the concepts in memory management, such as paging, segmentation and virtual memory, including page replacement algorithms. Know the implementation technique for MINIX or some actual operating system.
4. Apply the concepts in file management, such as directory structure, layout management, buffering, and data space management.
5. Have hands on experience with the implementation of schedulers, memory managers, and file-systems algorithms. Modify and extend an operating system such as MINIX.
6. Understand performance measurements and the importance of performance evaluation in operating system design.


## PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS
The programming assignments are an important component of the course. If all goes as planned, you will be implementing at least four major programming assignments demonstrating operating systems concepts.

We will be using C/C++ as the main programming language.

The programming assignments will be evaluated on several criteria:
- **Documentation**: your code must be well-commented and must include a design document describing your solution.
- **Correctness**: your code must do what it is supposed to do.
- **Structure**: your code should be broken into natural functions and modules.
- **Style**: your code should be easy to read, well indented, well commented, and use clear, self-explanatory variable and function names.

Your grade for each assignment will be based on your code (40%) and your demo/documentation (60%). Good understanding of code and documentation are absolutely crucial for this class, as simply implementing the required functionality is only a fraction of the grade for your code.
